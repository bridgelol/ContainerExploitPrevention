# Container Exploit Prevention
This plugin's primary goal is to prevent future exploits that exploit the renaming of container titles to manipulate poorly written plugins.
See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv1mCT8cR04

## How it works
We remove the container's custom name server-side and only show it to the client (provided ProtocolLib is installed).
This prevents the client from being able to rename the container and thus prevents exploits.

## Potential conflicts
This plugin could break certain plugins that rely on the container's custom name. Relying on container's custom name is terrible practice and should never be done.
- AdvancedChests -> Either disable container-name-override in the config or add title exemptions for titles AdvancedChests uses.

## Usage
- Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/bridgelol/ContainerExploitPrevention/releases). The plugin **should** work out of the box.
- This plugin is compiled using JDK 17. If you are using an older version of Java, you will need to compile it yourself.
- If you are using ProtocolLib, and want to show the container's custom name to the client, you will need to enable the option in the config. The plugin **should** work without ProtocolLib, however it will not re-render the container's custom name to the client.
```yaml
container-name-override: true
```
