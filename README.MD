# Container Exploit Prevention
This plugin's primary goal is to prevent future exploits that exploit the renaming of container titles to manipulate poorly written plugins.
See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv1mCT8cR04

## How it works
We remove the container's custom name server-side and only show it to the client (provided ProtocolLib is installed).
This prevents the client from being able to rename the container and thus prevents exploits.

## Potential conflicts
This plugin could break certain plugins that rely on the container's custom name. Relying on container's custom name is terrible practice and should never be done.
- AdvancedChests -> Either disable container-name-override in the config or add title exemptions for titles AdvancedChests uses.
