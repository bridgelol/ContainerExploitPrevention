# Container Exploit Prevention
This plugin's primary goal is to prevent future exploits that exploit the renaming of container titles to manipulate poorly written plugins.
See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv1mCT8cR04

## How it works
We remove the container's custom name server-side and only show it to the client (provided ProtocolLib is installed).
This prevents the client from being able to rename the container and thus prevents exploits.
